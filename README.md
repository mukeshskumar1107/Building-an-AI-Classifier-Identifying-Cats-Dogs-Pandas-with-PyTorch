# Building-an-AI-Classifier-Identifying-Cats-Dogs-Pandas-with-PyTorch
  
# Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using PyTorch for image classification.
The notebook (DEEP WORKSHOP2.ipynb) walks through data loading, preprocessing, model architecture, training, evaluation, and visualization.

# Setup Instructions

1. Clone or Download the Repository

2. Install Dependencies

3. Check CUDA Availability (GPU Support)


# Dataset

You can use datasets from Kaggle or other image classification sources.
To use Kaggle datasets directly in your notebook:

1.Install Kaggle CLI (already listed in requirements.txt):

2.Place your Kaggle API key (kaggle.json) in:

3.Download datasets:

4.Unzip and organize the dataset:

# Running the Notebook

Open the notebook:

Run all cells sequentially to:
